# Reputation-based Weighted Voting (RWV)

_RWV is a project by Token Engineering Academy Research (akrtws, Eightarmsninebrainsm and Vitor Marthendal), originating from an educational program at TE Academy. It provides vote weighting mechanisms, a simulator, and Snapshot Strategy templates to roll out votings where knowledge and achievements count. If you find a bug, feel free to report. If you do a PR where tests pass, we'll be happy to merge it. And feel free to fork this repo and change it as you wish._


### Introduction
The design space of token-based governance is enormous. However, in the reality of DAO governance, only a handful of primitives have achieved significant adoption. 1token1vote links voting power directly to the number of tokens held. Vote delegation allows token holders to assign their voting rights to another party, enabling concentrated decision-making power based on trust. Reputation-based Weighted Voting (RWV) aims to complement these concepts with a third class of voting mechanism: make a voterâ€™s track record count in decision-making and use proofs of expertise and achievements as a signal to define the voting weight and decision-making power.

This RWV Toolbox enables communities, governance researchers, and DAO participants to roll out reputation-based weighted voting in their community.

Use the RWV Toolbox, to...
* Integrate on-chain proofs to define voting power (ERC-20/ERC-721/ERC-1155)
* Select vote weighting mechanisms and customize parameters to make the vote weighting fit to your community
* Run ready-to-use simulations to test the parameter settings (dictatorship-proof, sybil resistance)
* Role out a RWV on Snapshot using the RWV Snapshot Strategies and your parameter setting
