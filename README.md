# Reputation-based Weighted Voting (RWV)

_RWV is a project by Token Engineering Academy Research (akrtws, Eightarmsninebrainsm and Vitor Marthendal), originating from an educational program at TE Academy. It provides vote weighting mechanisms, a simulator, and Snapshot Strategy templates to roll out votings where knowledge and achievements count. If you find a bug, feel free to report. If you do a PR where tests pass, we'll be happy to merge it. And feel free to fork this repo and change it as you wish._
