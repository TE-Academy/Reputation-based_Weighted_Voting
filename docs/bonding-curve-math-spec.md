# Bonding Curve Weighting Mechanism v1
## Math Specification 

**Overall Idea:**
The weight of a particular NFT is specified by a bonding curve. As this specific NFT becomes more common, the  

**Mathematical Specification**

There is a collection of NFTs, numbered 1 through $N$.
The weight of the $k$th NFT $w_k = f(x_k)$, where $w_k$ is the weight of NFT $k$ and the $x_k$ is the number of NFT $k$ that have been minted. 

# TODO: Running example: $w = 10/x$. 

# TODO: Add image of curve that could work.

# Idea: Discuss different curves.
